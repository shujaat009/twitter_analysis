## Project Overview

This project aimed to analyze Twitter data to extract valuable insights using Power BI. The analysis focuses on engagement trends, media interactions, and click behaviors, leveraging various data visualization techniques.

## Power BI Dashboard

The Power BI dashboard visualizes Twitter engagement data, including:
- **Line Chart**: Shows trends in engagement rates for tweets with and without media content.
- **Comparative Analysis**: Compares engagement rates for tweets posted during business hours.
- **Dual-Axis Chart**: Illustrates media views and engagements over time.
- **Pie Chart**: Represents the distribution of different click types.

The dashboard provides interactive features, such as filters and drill-downs, to facilitate data exploration.
